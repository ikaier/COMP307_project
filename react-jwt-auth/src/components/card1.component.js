        content="Two SOCS teams were awarded big grants to develop AI approaches that will enable improved understanding of cancer through genomics and epigenomics.

Professors Mathieu Blanchette and William Hamilton, and their team are working on deciphering mechanisms of epigenetic alterations in cancer using 3D-genomics-informed deep learning.

Adjunct Professor Marc Bellemare and collaborator Jacques Drouin (IRCM) are working on decoding the cancer epigenome with novel artificial intelligence discovery tools.

The funding was obtained through a highly competitive joint call for proposals from Genome QuÃ©bec, the Oncopole, and IVADO.
